```
merge(list1, list2)[k]
```

### Continuation

Do it in O(|list1| + |list2|) worst-case time

On the BART this morning, just working that hamster in my head solving this problem and writing creatively when, out of nowhere, this lovey-dovey Mexican (or at least Latin American) couples plots down in each others' arms on the seat dead in front of me. 

The guy, a buzz cut tough guy who probably gets into fights with his cousins against some other people and their cousins all the time, has his arms around a girl with damaged blond-highlights in her hair. Without a care in the world, he turns over to her, and sticks his tongue down her mouth, to which (although I cannot see to confirm), she counters by jabbing her tongue in his mouth in what could only be described as a massive teeth licking contest. 

At this moment, as they whisper sweet meaningless nothings into each others' mouths, I can only imagine the lewd extent to which they simply crave to re-explore the protusion and creavices each other's dirty light brown bodies. So thank god, for the stern prude old lady with the disapproving glance, the awkward Indian guy pretending to read, and the demure Asian schoolgirl shame-facedly looking away, else I cannot begin to imagine what would keep this guy from wetting himself in her on the seat right in front of me.

Ahh, the "lady" raises her arm and I catch the first glance of her barnacled blubbery skin. Truly thar she blows. Holy crap, she just sat up a bit more... goodness, she might really love her guy, but I bet she loves eating just as much.
