### Prompt

Given two sorted lists, provide an algorithm to find the kth smallest element of the union of the lists. In other words, implement:

```
merge(list1, list2)[k]
```

### Continuation

Do it in O(|list1| + |list2|) worst-case time

### Continuation part 2

Do it with arrays in O(log(|list1|) + log(|list2)) time
